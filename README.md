A collection of lightweight tools made to be hosted with GitHub pages.

So far the current tools include:

* A text reversal tool.
     * Includes instant preview and the option to copy the output to clipboard.
* A stutter-ify tool.
     * Changes "l" and "r" to "w" and adds a stutter with about 25% chance.
* A zalgo (void text) tool.
     * Transforms the input text to zalgo (void) text.
