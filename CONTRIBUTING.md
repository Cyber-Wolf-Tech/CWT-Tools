# Contributions are appreciated, but may be held to the following criteria:

## The basics:
### Test your code.
Yes, I know this is rather obvious, but it can't be emphasized enough. Bad code could take down the pages site, and *potentially* get your pull request closed.

### Don't make a lot of pull requests with one single change.
If you have a lot of small changes to make, try to include all of those in the same pull request so I don't have a flood of pull requests pile up when they aren't that important.

### Refrain from unnecessary changes.
Yes, that empty line might look bad there, but in reality it doesn't really make the code run any differently. If anything, I'll probably get bored one day and fix it myself as a direct commit.
Fixing something like this if your code/documentation/etc. change/fix is around there is fine, just not by itself in a pull request.

### Clearly document and label your changes.
This not only helps me as the reviewer to merge your change sooner, but also helps me keep track of what changed, where, and why. It also looks a lot cleaner.

### Make an issue with the __*"Feature Proposal"*__ template before working on a very big change.
This will help talk out your idea, and if I think it fits the scope of this project. That way you wont waste your time on something I might not accept.



#### Please note that this may not include all of the criteria, and all decisions are made solely by me, @Cyber-Wolf-Tech.
